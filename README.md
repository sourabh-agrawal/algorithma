# algorithma
This is a java project in which i used advance java concepts. This is more like graphic. This will help to understand algorithms like Dijkstra's, prims, insertion_sorting in a graphical way. like when user will login then he can choose what he want to learn then after clicking on it, a new window will open in which next, previous buttons are available. In the starting a graph will be drawn after clicking next button the next suitable node, that is going to be selected according to the algorithm, will get heighlighted which tell the user the flow of the algorithm.

This project is made in the netbeans ide.
go in the src folder there u can see the .java files.
only they are useful. ignore the .class files.
